The main difference that physical address is address to the real memory, so address limited by size of memory.
But virtual address uses mapping (use page table) to the real addresses of memory, so number of address could be more than size of the memory,
that give possibility to manage more addresses in processes (swapping and etc).
+several virtual addresses could point to one physical addresses (in different processes).
